## Comparison of Conversion Rates between AB Testing and Bidding Methods

**Business Problem**


> Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing
> "maximum bidding" type. One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct
> an A/B test to determine if average bidding results in more conversions than maximum bidding. The A/B test has been
> running for 1 month, and bombabomba.com now wants you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success
> metric for bombabomba.com is Purchase,so the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.


**Dataset Story**

> This dataset contains information about a company's website, including the number of ad impressions and clicks by
> users, as well as revenue generated from these ads. There are two separate data sets: Control and Test groups. These
> data sets are located on separate sheets in the ab_testing.xlsx Excel file. Maximum Bidding was applied to the
> Control group, while Average Bidding was applied to the Test group."
